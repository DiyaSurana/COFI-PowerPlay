# COFI-PowerPlay

 ## Background and Problem:
- The COFI PowerPlay case study offers a comprehensive analysis of global energy investments, particularly focusing on projects funded by Chinese financial institutions under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Leveraging data from the China Overseas Finance Inventory (COFI) Database, it examines investment patterns in power-generation projects across BRIcountries. Designed for data science professionals, the case study presents a critical view of the strategic and economic complexities surrounding China's global energy financing. The key challenge is to explore investment trends, assess regional impacts, and derive data-driven insights into China's growing influence in the global energy market.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information on global energy projects financed by Chinese firms under the BRI, including:
- Country → BRI member countries.
- Project type → Power-generation projects (e.g., coal, hydro, solar, wind).
- Investment amount → Funding provided for each project.
- Year → Year of investment.
-  Energy output → Power capacity generated (MW)

## Tools used:
- Looker google studio → For interactive data visualization.
- Kaggle Dataset  → [COFI_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivavashishtha/china-overseas-finance-inventory-database/data)

## Conclusion:
The COFI PowerPlay project reveals that:
- China's BRI investments have a significant impact on global energy infrastructure.
- Although coal projects dominate, there is a gradual shift toward renewable energy investments.
- Geographical concentration of funding highlights China's strategic interests in specific regions.

## Recommendations:
- Increase renewable investments → To promote sustainability.
-  Diversify funding → Broaden the geographical spread of investments.
-  Monitor financial risks → Track project returns and sustainability impacts.
